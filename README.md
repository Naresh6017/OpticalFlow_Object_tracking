# OpticalFlow_Object_tracking
This repo is my personal project to devise a model for object tracking using OpticalFlow. The problem I currently face is limited computational resource. Hopefully sometime in the future I will have access to powerful GPU's so that I can make a reliable model. 
However, I made sure to implement a basic object tracking model from a simple tutorial online. I think this model is like the most basic object tracking model. XD
